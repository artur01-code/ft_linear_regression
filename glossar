rmse = Root-mean-square deviation = Mittlere quadratische Abweichung
RMSE: A metric that tells us how far apart the predicted values are from the observed values in a dataset, on average.
    The lower the RMSE, the better a model fits a dataset.
R2: A metric that tells us the proportion of the variance in the response variable of a regression model
    that can be explained by  the predictor variables. This value ranges from 0 to 1. The higher the R2 value, the better a model fits a dataset.
One one hand, RMSE tells us the typical distance between the predicted value made by the regression model and the actual value.
On the other hand, R2 tells us how well the predictor variables can explain the variation in the response variable.
